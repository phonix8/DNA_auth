# DNA Sequencing Simulation

This project provides a Python-based simulation of the DNA sequencing process. It's designed to demonstrate the basic concepts of DNA sequencing, including genome generation, fragmentation, error simulation, and sequence assembly.

## Features

- Generate a sample genome of customizable length
- Fragment the DNA into smaller, overlapping pieces
- Simulate sequencing errors
- Assemble the genome from fragmented pieces
- Calculate assembly accuracy
- Analyze base pair frequencies
- Save original and assembled genomes to files
- Interactive command-line interface
- Includes a CPU-intensive task for performance testing

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dna-sequencing-simulation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd dna-sequencing-simulation
   ```

## Usage

Run the simulation using Python:

```
python enhanced_dna_sequencing_simulation.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to progress through each stage of the simulation.

## Output

The simulation will generate two text files:
- `original_genome.txt`: Contains the originally generated genome sequence
- `assembled_genome.txt`: Contains the assembled genome sequence after fragmentation and reassembly
